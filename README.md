# AI Basics: Semantic Similarity & AI Development Tools

## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to AI development, focusing on:
- Setting up Python environments with Poetry
- Managing dependencies with Poetry and UV
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Containerizing AI projects with Docker
- Building and serving a semantic similarity API using FastAPI and Sentence Transformers

You will learn how to train models, serve them via an API, and interact with them through a modern web interface.

---

## Features

- **Semantic Similarity API**: REST API for generating text embeddings and calculating semantic similarity using Sentence Transformers.
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly HTML frontend for comparing text similarity and generating embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Example scripts for training and saving a Random Forest classifier on the Iris dataset.
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose support for reproducible environments.
- **Development Guide**: Step-by-step Jupyter notebook for setting up and managing your AI project.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Poetry

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry --version
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
poetry install
```

### 3. Train Example Model

```sh
poetry run python src/ai_training/train_model.py
```

### 4. Run the Semantic Similarity API

```sh
poetry run python src/ai_training/embedding_service.py
```
it should say 
```
INFO:     Started server process [XXXX]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
Loading model all-MiniLM-L6-v2...
Model loaded successfully!
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```
when it has finished setting up the Port and Application for use

## Using Docker

Build and run the Jupyter environment:

```sh
docker build -t ai-basics .
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app ai-basics
```

Or use Docker Compose for both Jupyter and API services:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## Example API Endpoints

- `POST /embedding` — Get embedding for a single text
- `POST /batch_embedding` — Get embeddings for a list of texts
- `POST /similarity` — Compute semantic similarity between two texts

See [`src/ai_training/embedding_service.py`](src/ai_training/embedding_service.py) for details.
